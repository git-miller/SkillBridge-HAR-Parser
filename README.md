- Open website: https://skillbridge.osd.mil/locations.htm
- CTRL + SHIFT + E (Opens dev tool network tab)
- On the website, click the SEARCH button
- Look for a fairly large XML file in the list
- Right click anywhere on that line and "Save All as HAR"
- Save that to the same directory as this script
- Modify the filename in the script or change your filename to 'example.har'
- Run the python parser.py and it should output example.csv (if name wasn't changed)
